#My Micrograd

This is effectively a copy of [@karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)'s [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). I made it to teach myself about autograd and neural network basics. There are some superficial rewrites and a bit of code golf vs micrograd. But it effectively does the same thing.

In my tests file, I write the grad calculations by hand. This may be useful for anyone struggling to intuit how the tool works.
